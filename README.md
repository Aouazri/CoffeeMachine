# CoffeeMachine
I've created a virtual Coffee Machine where you get to choose between latte, cappuccino and espresso. The machine would then ask you to insert coins, if the transaction is completed
it'll return the change+ your drink and it'll update the resources in the machine, otherwhise it'll refund your money. 
The machine will continue serving clients until someone from maintenance writes the keyword "OFF"
